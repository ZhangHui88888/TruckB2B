## Introduction

Choosing the right headlamps for your heavy truck is crucial for safety and compliance. Whether you're operating a VOLVO, SCANIA, MERCEDES-BENZ, MAN, or IVECO, proper lighting ensures visibility during night driving and adverse weather conditions.

## OEM vs Aftermarket Headlamps

### OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)

OEM headlamps are made by the same manufacturer that supplied the original parts to the truck maker. They offer:

- **Perfect fit** - Designed specifically for your truck model
- **Guaranteed quality** - Meets all original specifications
- **Warranty coverage** - Often comes with manufacturer warranty

### Aftermarket Options

Quality aftermarket headlamps can provide excellent value:

- **Cost-effective** - Often 30-50% less than OEM
- **Wide availability** - Easier to source globally
- **Comparable quality** - Top manufacturers meet OEM standards

## Key Features to Consider

### 1. Light Technology

- **Halogen** - Traditional, affordable, easy to replace
- **LED** - Energy-efficient, longer lifespan, brighter output
- **Xenon/HID** - Intense brightness, premium option

### 2. Housing Material

Look for headlamps with:
- UV-resistant polycarbonate lenses
- Corrosion-resistant housing
- Proper sealing against moisture

### 3. Certification

Ensure your headlamps meet:
- ECE regulations (Europe)
- DOT standards (USA)
- Local country requirements
